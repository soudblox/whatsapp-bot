# WhatsApp Bot

A simple WhatsApp Bot I made for my friends' group chat powered by `whatsapp-web.js` and `puppeteer`. Handlers "
inspired" by the Discord framework [GCommands](https://github.com/Garlic-Team/gcommands/), "remade" for WhatsApp,
removed useless things I don't need.

Also, my first project using TypeScript

# Self Hosting

The bot is made easy to self-host, but I will not give assistance if you encounter any troubles trying to self-host.
